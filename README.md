# Feature_Engineering
In this project we will explore supervised methods for feature selection, including "Filter", "Wrapper", and "Embedded" methods. 

### Filter Methods
- Correlation with the target variable
- Correlation with other features
- Univariate Selection

 ### Wrapper Methods
- Recursive Feature Elimination
- Forward Elimination
- Backward Elimination

### Embedded Methods
- Feature Importances
- L1 Regularization
