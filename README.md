# Feature_Engineering
In this project we will explore supervised methods for feature selection, including "Filter", "Wrapper", and "Embedded" methods. You can download the dataset from [this link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic).

### Filter Methods
- Correlation with the target variable
- Correlation with other features
- Univariate Selection

 ### Wrapper Methods
- Recursive Feature Elimination
- Forward Elimination
- Backward Elimination

### Embedded Methods
- Feature Importances
- L1 Regularization
